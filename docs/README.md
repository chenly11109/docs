### in the future
-  ~~Graphics - c++ / graphics,WebGL, three.js, unity, etc.~~
-  WebXR Fundamentals:
~~WebGL~~, WebXR, A-Frame, Three.js, Unity
- WebXR, which is a JavaScript API for creating immersive experiences on the web.
Learn about the different components of WebXR, such as VR (Virtual Reality), AR (Augmented Reality), and MR (Mixed Reality).
Familiarize yourself with the concepts of scenes, entities, controllers, and interactions in the context of WebXR.
-  A-Frame:
A-Frame is a powerful and beginner-friendly framework for creating WebXR experiences. It is built on top of Three.js and provides a declarative approach to building scenes.
Begin by exploring the A-Frame documentation (https://aframe.io/docs/) to understand the core concepts, entities, components, and system architecture.
Work through the official A-Frame tutorials, which cover topics like creating 3D scenes, working with entities, applying textures and materials, and adding interactivity.
Practice building simple A-Frame projects, starting with basic scenes and gradually incorporating more advanced features like animations, physics, and user interactions.
-  Three.js:
Three.js is a powerful JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics and animations in the browser.
Begin with the Three.js documentation (https://threejs.org/docs/) to gain an understanding of the library's core concepts, including scenes, cameras, geometries, materials, and lights.
Follow online tutorials and guides that walk you through the process of creating different types of 3D scenes and effects using Three.js.
Explore the vast collection of examples provided on the Three.js website to see how various features and effects can be achieved.
-  JavaScript and WebGL:
WebXR, A-Frame, and Three.js are built on JavaScript and leverage WebGL for rendering graphics.
Ensure you have a solid understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, including variables, functions, loops, and conditionals.
Familiarize yourself with the basics of WebGL, which is the underlying technology for rendering 3D graphics in the browser. Understand concepts like shaders, buffers, and rendering pipelines.

-  programming language & object-oriented design
-  software system
-  backend language & SQL
- ~~cloud services?~~
    - Cloud Computing Basics: This free course on Udacity provides a comprehensive introduction to cloud computing, including the basics of cloud infrastructure, virtualization, and containerization.

    - AWS for Front-End Engineers: This course on Pluralsight is designed specifically for front-end developers who want to learn how to build applications on AWS. The course covers topics such as deploying applications, working with serverless architecture, and using AWS Lambda.

    - Serverless Framework: The Serverless Framework is an open-source toolkit that allows you to build and deploy serverless applications on various cloud platforms, including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. You can follow their tutorials to learn how to build serverless applications using your front-end development skills.

    - Cloud Resume Challenge: This project by Forrest Brazeal is a popular hands-on project for beginners to practice their cloud skills. The challenge involves building a serverless resume website on AWS using various services, such as AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and S3.

    - Cloud Guru: A Cloud Guru is a popular online learning platform that offers courses and certifications for cloud computing. They have a wide range of courses, including courses specifically for front-end developers, such as "Serverless for Front-End Developers."
