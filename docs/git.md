## git rebase vs git merge

history rewriting

rebasing is changing the base of your branch from one commit to another making it appear as if you'd created your branch from a different commit.

### git rebase <base>

This automatically rebases the current branch onto ＜ base ＞, which can be any kind of commit reference (for example an ID, a branch name, a tag, or a relative reference to HEAD).

### git rebase -i(--interactive) <base>

## git commit -a -m "....."
